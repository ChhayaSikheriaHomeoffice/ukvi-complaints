To make a complaint on behalf of someone else you must have their explicit consent, or have agreed consent from the Home Office, to handle this information.

If you make a complaint on behalf of someone else without their prior consent, or without approval from the Home Office, you will be committing an unlawful act, as described in section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998.
